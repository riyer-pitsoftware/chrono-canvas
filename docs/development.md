# ChronoCanvas — Development Guide

---

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ (for frontend development outside Docker)
- Python 3.11+ (for backend development outside Docker)
- 8 GB RAM minimum; 16 GB recommended if running local LLMs

### FaceFusion (optional)

Face compositing is handled by a locally cloned copy of [FaceFusion](https://github.com/facefusion/facefusion). It is independent of the `IMAGE_PROVIDER` setting — you can use ComfyUI for portrait generation and FaceFusion for face compositing simultaneously.

1. Clone FaceFusion somewhere on your machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/facefusion/facefusion.git ~/code/facefusion
   ```
2. Set `FACEFUSION_SOURCE_PATH` in your `.env` to the absolute path of that clone:
   ```
   FACEFUSION_SOURCE_PATH=/home/yourname/code/facefusion
   ```
3. Set `FACEFUSION_ENABLED=true` in `.env`.

The directory is bind-mounted into the `facefusion` Docker service at `/facefusion`. ONNX models are downloaded on first use into the `ff_models` Docker volume and persisted across restarts. Leave `FACEFUSION_ENABLED=false` (the default) to use a mock overlay instead.

The FaceFusion Docker service uses a compose profile and does not start by default. To include it:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --profile facefusion up -d
```

## Starting the dev stack

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # configure once
make dev                   # starts db, redis, api (Docker Compose)
make frontend              # starts Vite dev server (localhost:3000)
make seed                  # loads seed figures and periods into the database
```

All Docker services are defined in `docker-compose.dev.yml`. The API server runs with hot reload enabled.

### Access points

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 |
| API / Swagger | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| PostgreSQL | localhost:5432 |
| Redis | localhost:6379 |

## Common commands

```bash
# Lifecycle
make start      # build + start all services (alias: make dev)
make stop       # stop all services (alias: make down)
make restart    # stop + start
make fresh      # full reset: volumes wiped, rebuilt, re-seeded

# Monitoring
make status     # show running containers
make logs       # tail all service logs
make logs-api   # tail API logs only
make logs-worker    # tail worker logs only
make logs-frontend  # tail frontend logs only
make health     # curl health endpoints for API and frontend

# Shell access
make shell-api  # bash into the API container
make db-shell   # psql into the database

# Development
make backend    # run API server with hot reload (outside Docker)
make frontend   # run Vite dev server
make test       # run all tests
make seed       # load seed data
make migrate    # run Alembic database migrations
make up         # start all Docker services
make down       # stop all Docker services
make build      # rebuild Docker images
make clean      # full clean including volumes and generated output
```

## Docker entrypoint & service startup

Both the `api` and `worker` containers use a shared entrypoint script (`docker/entrypoint.sh`) that runs before the main process:

1. **Wait for PostgreSQL** — TCP check on `db:5432` with 30-second timeout
2. **Wait for Redis** — TCP check on `redis:6379` with 30-second timeout
3. **Run Alembic migrations** — only when `RUN_MIGRATIONS=true` (set for `api`, not `worker`)
4. **Exec into the command** — `uvicorn` for api, `arq` for worker

The TCP checks use `docker/wait-for-it.sh`, a lightweight netcat-based utility. This provides a safety net on top of Docker Compose's `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` — if a service becomes briefly unavailable after its health check passes, the entrypoint will wait rather than crash.

Environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `RUN_MIGRATIONS` | `false` | Set to `true` to run `alembic upgrade head` on startup |
| `DB_HOST` | `db` | PostgreSQL hostname for wait check |
| `DB_PORT` | `5432` | PostgreSQL port for wait check |
| `REDIS_HOST` | `redis` | Redis hostname for wait check |
| `REDIS_PORT` | `6379` | Redis port for wait check |

## Running tests

```bash
make test                            # all tests
pytest backend/tests/ -v             # backend only
pytest backend/tests/test_face_swap.py -v  # single file
npm test --prefix frontend           # frontend only
```

The backend test suite uses `pytest-asyncio`. Tests that require database access use an in-memory SQLite fixture; tests that require LLM calls mock the provider.

## Database migrations

Migrations are managed with Alembic.

```bash
# Apply pending migrations
make migrate

# Create a new migration after changing a SQLAlchemy model
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec api \
  alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe your change"
```

Migration files live in `backend/src/chronocanvas/db/migrations/versions/`.

---

## Adding a new LLM provider

1. Create `backend/src/chronocanvas/llm/providers/your_provider.py` implementing `LLMProvider`
2. Override `generate()` for standard completions
3. Override `generate_stream()` to enable token streaming — call `await on_token(chunk)` per token; the base class falls back to `generate()` if not overridden
4. Register the provider in `backend/src/chronocanvas/llm/router.py`
5. Add the required environment variables to `.env.example` with descriptions

---

## Adding a new agent node

1. Create `backend/src/chronocanvas/agents/nodes/your_agent.py`
   - Accept `state: AgentState` as input
   - Return a partial `AgentState` dict
   - Append an entry to `agent_trace`
2. Register the node in `backend/src/chronocanvas/agents/graph.py`
3. If the agent needs LLM routing, add a `TaskType` entry in `backend/src/chronocanvas/llm/router.py`

---

## Adding a new image backend

1. Create `backend/src/chronocanvas/imaging/your_backend.py` implementing `ImageGenerator`
2. Override `generate()` returning `ImageResult`
3. Override `is_available()` to return a health check result
4. Register the backend in `backend/src/chronocanvas/imaging/__init__.py`
5. Add configuration variables to `.env.example`

---

## Not production-ready

ChronoCanvas is a prototype and research system. The following are explicitly out of scope:

- **Authentication / authorization** — no user accounts, no auth middleware, no RBAC. Designed for trusted local networks only.
- **Multi-tenant isolation** — single-user, single-instance. No data partitioning between users.
- **Secrets management** — API keys are stored in `.env` files. No vault integration, no rotation.
- **Queue durability** — ARQ jobs are enqueued to Redis with no persistence guarantees. A Redis restart loses pending jobs.
- **High availability / SLOs** — single-instance services, no health-based failover, no redundancy.
- **Storage** — local filesystem only. No object storage (S3, GCS), no CDN.
- **Audit log retention** — `llm_calls` and `agent_trace` JSON columns grow unbounded. No archival or pruning.

If you are evaluating ChronoCanvas as an architecture reference, these are the areas you would harden for production use.

---

## Code style

- Backend: Python 3.11+, `ruff` for linting and formatting, `mypy` for type checking
- Frontend: ESLint + Prettier with the project's `.eslintrc` config
- Commit messages: imperative mood, present tense, reference bead IDs where applicable

---

## CLI

The CLI is a separate package in `cli/`. Install it in development mode:

```bash
pip install -e cli/
```

```bash
chronocanvas add figure          # Add a historical figure
chronocanvas generate            # Generate a portrait from text
chronocanvas batch               # Batch generation from a JSON file
chronocanvas status <id>         # Check generation status
chronocanvas download <id>       # Download generated image
chronocanvas list figures        # List figures with search/filter
chronocanvas list generations    # List generation requests
chronocanvas validate <id>       # Show validation results
chronocanvas agents list         # List available agents
chronocanvas agents llm-status   # Check LLM provider availability
chronocanvas agents costs        # Show LLM cost summary
```
